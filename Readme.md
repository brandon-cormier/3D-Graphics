The following are a series of assignments I completed for CSC418-Computer Graphics at University of Toronto. There was some starter code provided by the course instructor David Levin.

The src folders in each project contain the files I worked on, while the cmake project, the header files and the additional assets were provided by Prof. Levin. 

The handouts that were provided for the assignment are in each assignment folder as readme.html or readme.md. 
There are additional readme files in the src folder of projects that give more explanation about my contribution and a quick guide on how to use each project build.
